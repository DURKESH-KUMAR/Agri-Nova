# 🌾 Agri-Nova

**Prototype Model – Agri Nova (Arduino + Unity)**

This repository contains the prototype model for **Agri-Nova**, an agricultural innovation project built using **Arduino hardware** and a **Unity application**.  
The purpose of Agri-Nova is to bridge physical farming sensors and real-time visual interfaces to improve monitoring and interaction with agricultural environments.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Agri-Nova integrates:

- **Arduino microcontroller modules** to collect sensor data from the field (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, humidity)
- **Unity application** to visualize and interact with real-world agricultural sensor data
- A prototype workflow that demonstrates how embedded systems and game-engine environments can be used together for smart farming solutions

This project is ideal as a **proof-of-concept** for interactive agricultural tools, farm monitoring interfaces, and educational prototypes combining hardware and software.
